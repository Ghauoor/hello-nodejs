# Node.js Overview

- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server-side. It is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side application development in JavaScript.
- **Maintained by**: OpenJS Foundation.
- **Architecture**: Event-driven architecture with asynchronous, non-blocking I/O.

## History and Background

- **Creator**: Ryan Dahl initially started the project with SpiderMonkey (for 2 days) before switching to the V8 engine.
- Early versions of Node.js used the SpiderMonkey engine, but it now exclusively uses the V8 engine.
- **Supported By**: Joyent, the company behind Node.js, and its first major user.

## Naming Evolution

- **Original Name**: web.js, created as a web server.
- **Current Name**: Node.js, reflecting its broader functionality beyond a basic web server.

## Node.js in Context

- **Apache HTTP Server**: Before Node.js, Apache HTTP was commonly used for web servers, which were blocking servers. Node.js introduced a non-blocking approach to I/O, making it ideal for scalable applications.

## Milestones

- **2010**: npm was launched by Joyent to manage Node.js packages. A package is a collection of modules that can be used in Node.js applications.
- **2011**: Windows support was added to Node.js with the help of Microsoft.
- **2012**: Ryan Dahl left the project; Isaac Z. Schlueter (creator of npm) took over.
- **2014**: Node.js was forked by Fedor Indutny and renamed to io.js.
- **2015**: io.js and Node.js projects merged back, forming the Node.js Foundation.
